# What is AiCrawler?

A web scraping pattern using heuristics with Symfony Components.

The AiCrawler package has the responsibility of making boolean assertions on a node in the HTML DOM. It comes with a straight-forward data point trait which will record the results of your heuristics (rules) for a given "item" or context.
