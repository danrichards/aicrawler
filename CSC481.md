#Content Scraper (Particularly, Articles)

I would like to write a proprietary algorithm for content scraping using Symfony components. The search would draw on
some inspirations from A* but be quite different. Web pages host articles that are reasonably predictable, so strong
heuristics will be defined but the algorithm will remain robust.

###Implementation Goal:

    Download html source for a web page. Search DOM elements (using defined / configurable heuristics) for a content
    body, headline and image. Apply scores to elements in a node structure and use a heuristic for choosing the next
    element to traverse.

    Right now, I'm thinking of a few different "smaller goals" for the grading of content and providing a robust
    algorithm.

###Heuristics for content body to consider:

*Depth of the node (the "real" content should be pretty deep)
*How do we pick the next node (div, article, span, blockquote)?
*How good is the content?
*Word count and number of word matches from a frequency list
*Good text content generally isn't polluted with other junk (worthless nodes embedded within)
*Other considerations upon discovery / testing.
*When do we throw stuff out?

###Heuristics for content header to consider:

*HTML entity, H1, H2, H3, Header?
*Word count.
*Depth from text content.
*Pollution score: are there other garbage nodes with in the current node.

###Heuristics for the image to consider:

*Depth from text content.
*Nodes in which it's embedded.
*Image size, width, height.
