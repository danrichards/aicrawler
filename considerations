Other considerations:

    Content Area:
        relevant tag count (p, blockquote, ) tag count for scoring content area
        content regex in id or class for content area
        has content parent (id, class or attribute)
        has article parent
        content level style tags (em, i, u)

    Heading:
        h1 or title tag
        highest order h tag in content area
        something with the largest font size

    Image:
        Node location, size, file size, domain

    Indices:
        Linear Frequency, does a certain tag appear multiple times in a row, at the same depth?

    Fully walking through and building an index with scoresâ€¦then picking content, header and image.

    Or

    Scoring as you go and picking to separate "consideration" lists to sort at the end?

    Stop points? Depth limits? Scoring content? Throwing out content / nodes from our index?

    Time abiding, write another class for curating links from an article listing (index page). This would provide
    articles to feed the scraper. I have some stuff I wrote already that scans and organizes hyperlinks, so this
    shouldn't be too bad.

    Time abiding; provide a very basic newsfeed of the scraped content.
